# to_be.Ruby <!-- omit in toc -->

Simple Ruby library determining whether strings indicate truey or falsy values.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/to_be.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/to_be)


## Introduction

**to-be** is a library providing facilities for determine whether the truthyness of strings. It implemented in several languages: **to_be.Rust** is the **Ruby** implementation.

## Terminology

The term "*truthy*" is an unhelpfully overloaded term in the programming world, insofar as it is used to refer to the notion of "truthyness" - whether something can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as truth - and also the true side of that interpretation. In this library, the former interpretation is used, leaving us with the following terms:

* "*truthy*" - whether something can be can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as having truth;
* "*falsey*" - whether an object can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as being false;
* "*truey*" - whether an object can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as being true;

For example, consider the following **Ruby** program:

```Ruby
require 'to_be'

s1 = "no"
s2 = "True"
s3 = "orange"

# "no" is validly truthy, and is falsey
ToBe.string_falsey?(s1) # => true
ToBe.string_truey?(s1) # => false
ToBe.string_truthy?(s1) # => true

# "True" is validly truthy, and is truey
ToBe.string_falsey?(s2) # => false
ToBe.string_truey?(s2) # => true
ToBe.string_truthy?(s2) # => true

# "orange" is not validly truthy, and is neither falsey nor truey
ToBe.string_falsey?(s3) # => false
ToBe.string_truey?(s3) # => false
ToBe.string_truthy?(s3) # => false
```

and, if extensions are used, the following **Ruby** program:

```Ruby
require 'to_be/extensions/string'

s1 = "no"
s2 = "True"
s3 = "orange"

# "no" is validly truthy, and is falsey
s1.falsey? # => true
s1.truey? # => false
s1.truthy? # => true

# "True" is validly truthy, and is truey
s2.falsey? # => false
s2.truey? # => true
s2.truthy? # => true

# "orange" is not validly truthy, and is neither falsey nor truey
s3.falsey? # => false
s3.truey? # => false
s3.truthy? # => false
```
